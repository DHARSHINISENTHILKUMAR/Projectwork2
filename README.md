## Title of the Project
Detection of Phishing Websites Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on identifying phishing websites by analyzing various website features using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of multiple attributes such as the presence of IP addresses in URLs, URL length, HTTPS usage, domain registration length, website traffic, and other factors that distinguish phishing sites from legitimate ones. By training a machine learning model on this dataset, the system can accurately classify websites as either phishing or safe. The goal of this project is to enhance online security by providing an automated and efficient method to detect fraudulent websites, helping users avoid potential scams and cyber threats.
## About
The Detection of Phishing Websites Using Machine Learning project aims to develop a system that can identify fraudulent websites based on various key features. Phishing websites are designed to deceive users by imitating legitimate platforms to steal sensitive information such as login credentials and financial details.
This project utilizes a dataset containing multiple attributes that indicate whether a website is legitimate or phishing. Features such as URL structure, HTTPS usage, domain registration period, and website traffic are analyzed to train a machine learning model. The model then classifies websites as either safe or phishing based on patterns observed in the data.

## Features
Implements machine learning algorithms for phishing website detection.
Analyzes multiple website attributes, including URL structure, HTTPS usage, and domain details.
High accuracy in detecting phishing websites based on trained models.
A framework-based application for easy deployment and integration.
Low time complexity for real-time phishing detection.
Scalable solution capable of handling large datasets.
Automated classification of websites into phishing or legitimate categories.
Provides enhanced cybersecurity by reducing user exposure to phishing threats.

## Requirements
*Random Forest Classifier – Uses an ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
*Decision Tree Classifier – A tree-based model that splits data based on feature conditions for classification.
*Logistic Regression – A statistical model used for binary classification of phishing and legitimate websites.
*AdaBoost Classifier – An adaptive boosting technique that improves weak learners to enhance classification performance.
*Gradient Boosting – A boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially to minimize errors and improve accuracy.
*K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A distance-based algorithm that classifies websites based on similarity to neighbors.
*Support Vector Machine (SVM) – A classification model that finds the optimal decision boundary for phishing detection.

## Results and Impact
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used to detect phishing websites, which are fraudulent sites designed to steal sensitive information. ML models analyze features like URL length, SSL certificates, domain registration, and page content to differentiate between legitimate and phishing websites. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are trained on labeled datasets to identify phishing patterns. ML-based detection systems offer faster, more accurate results and adapt to new phishing tactics. By integrating into web browsers and security software, they provide real-time protection, effectively safeguarding users from phishing attacks and preventing data theft.
